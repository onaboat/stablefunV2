Stables.fun – Decentralized Stablecoins on Solana backed by Etherfuse Stablebonds.

Overview
Stables.fun is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Solana blockchain, enabling users to mint stablecoins backed by real-world assets like government bonds via Stablebonds. It blends traditional finance with blockchain technology to deliver secure, transparent, and yield-bearing tokens.

Inspired by platforms like Pump.fun, Stables.fun allows users to create custom stablecoins tied to fiat currencies, earning 6–12% annual returns through Etherfuse Stablebonds.
